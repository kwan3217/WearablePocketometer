Best-effort reconstruction of board as it existed on 2020-08-27 and 2020-10-09 when it was sent to the fab. 
This includes three kicad_pcb files which actually *are* the files that were on oshpark, as well as schematics
pulled from the tag on the old Kicad repository. Also including the KwanSystems.lib as it existed then. No
3D models or footprints -- the footprints are embedded in the kicad_pcb files, and the 3D models are
not needed for this purpose. Library copied from later version, as the library was not checked in. Since
they are just symbols, basically 'write once, ready many' data, it's fine that it's a later version.
